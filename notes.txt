UPDATE Forward FUNCTION to zero the last number of like : need to check how to manage not using the actual numbe of likes in the previous tokens prediction when the block has multiple tokens
need to make the first layer with one head (since the 512image embedding + 1number of like doesn't make sense to be splitted over heads)
Maybe need to update the scaling approach for number of likes. global scalar vs per page or per batch? 
lm_head linear ? :/
